I am a Master's student in the Department of Biological Sciences at Florida Atlantic University working with Dr. Michael Salmon. I'm currently studying the impact of the fire ant pesticide hydramethylnon (AMDRO) on loggerhead sea turtle reproductive success and hatchling quality. 

# Current Project
Marine turtles are charismatic megafauna that have been the focus of a massive conservation effort in the last several decades. Some populations have enjoyed a promising recovery, while others are continuing to decline. The future of these animals remains in jeopardy due to a variety of anthropogenic threats, including fisheries bycatch, climate change, and poaching. In addition to these threats, sea turtles face pressure from nonnative terrestrial nest predators such as wild hogs, feral dogs, and fire ants.  

Hydramethylnon (AMDRO) is widely used on sea turtle nesting beaches for the control of imported fire ants, but the effect of this pesticide on sea turtle hatchlings (or any reptile species) remains unknown. The aim of my research is to investigate the impact of hydramethylnon on loggerhead sea turtle reproductive success and hatchling quality to determine if the application of this pesticide on sea turtle nests is a safe practice. My eventual goal is to enable wildlife management personnel to make informed decisions with regards to use of this pesticide and ant removal on vulnerable sea turtle nesting beaches.  

## Past Projects
In the past, I have worked with the South Florida Water Management District on the Kissimmee River Restoration Project, conducting fish  and geomorphic profile surveys of the restored river channel. I have also conducted swimming endurance studies with endangered lake sturgeon to determine the likelihood of their being impacted by dredging activity. In high school, I entertained myself by wading through floodplain pools, attending NANFA meetings, catching snakes, and participating in an embarassing number of science competitions.

# Outreach Activities
In addition to research activities, I have a passion for environmental education and community outreach. I have been a counselor at youth environmental camps, led workshops on the identification and safe handling of reptiles and amphibians, and been an invited speaker at several public wildlife festivals. I enjoy convincing kids (and sometimes even their parents) that reptiles are cool, girls can play in the mud, and the environment is something worth protecting.
