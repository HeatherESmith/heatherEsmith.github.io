I am a Master's student in the Department of Biological Sciences at Florida Atlantic University working with Dr. Michael Salmon in collaboration with Loggerhead MarineLife Center in Juno Beach, Florida. I'm currently studying the impact of the fire ant pesticide hydramethylnon (AMDRO) on loggerhead sea turtle reproductive success and hatchling quality. 

The predaceous red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) is an invasive species that is considered a significant threat to some sea turtle nesting beaches, especially low-density nesting areas where nest predators can significantly impact population dynamics. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission currently recommends fire ant removal by pouring boiling water onto mounds, or by physically removing mounds with a shovel and bucket. These methods are not only impractical at many nesting sites, but also potentially risky to wildlife management personnel and the sea turtle nests they are trying to protect. 

In addition to the physical removal of fire ant colonies, the pesticide hydramethylnon (AMDRO) is used to eradicate fire ant mounds in proximity to sea turtle nests. While experimental data have shown that a reduction in RIFA populations through the use of hydramethylnon has led to increased herpetofaunal abundance, hydramethylnon is also known to be mildly to highly toxic to some vertebrate species. However, the effect of this pesticide on sea turtle hatchlings remains unknown. The aim of my research is to investigate the impact of hydramethylnon on loggerhead sea turtle reproductive success and hatchling quality to determine if the application of this pesticide on sea turtle nests is a safe alternative to the physical removal of fire ant mounds, enabling wildlife management personnel to make informed decisions with regards to use of this pesticide and ant removal on vulnerable sea turtle nesting beaches.
